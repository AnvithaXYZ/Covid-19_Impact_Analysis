# Covid-19_Impact_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and comparison of COVID-19 data from India, the USA, and globally. The objective is to explore the impact of the pandemic through various statistical analyses and visualizations. The project also aims to predict future trends and provide insights into how different demographics were affected.

## Datasets

The following datasets have been used in this project:

1. **COVID-19 Cases in India**  
   [Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india)  
   Contains time-series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 in each Indian state at a daily level.

2. **COVID-19 Cases in the USA**  
   [Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa)  
   Includes information from 50 US states and the District of Columbia at a daily level, detailing the number of people affected by the virus.

3. **COVID-19 Cases Worldwide**  
   [Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/themrityunjaypathak/covid-cases-and-deaths-worldwide)  
   A global dataset with fields such as total number of cases, total recoveries, deaths, and other related fields.

## Research Questions

1. **COVID Positive Ratio Analysis**  
   Which country has the highest COVID positive ratio in percentage?  
   - **Attributes:** Total positive cases, recovered cases, population.

2. **Comparative Analysis of India and USA**  
   How does the COVID-19 situation in India compare to that in the USA?  
   - **Method:** Exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
   
4. **Death Toll Analysis**  
   What is the global death toll due to COVID-19, and how does it compare across different regions?  
   - **Focus:** Death rates and their correlation with other factors.

5. **Demographic Impact Analysis**  
   How has COVID-19 impacted different age groups, genders, and ethnicities in India, the USA, and worldwide?  
   - **Comparison:** Significant differences across these demographics.

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, normalizing values, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and initial insights into the data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Identifying relationships between variables and significant differences between groups.
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Forecasting future trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- **Regression Analysis:** Predicting potential outcomes based on historical data.

## Potential Outcomes

- Insights into the COVID positive ratio across countries.
- Comparative analysis between India and the USA.
- Understanding the global death toll and its regional variations.
- Demographic-specific impact assessment of COVID-19.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization.
- **Statsmodels** - Statistical analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning models for regression and forecasting.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on different countries and demographics. Through the use of statistical and predictive modeling techniques, we aim to uncover meaningful insights and future trends.
